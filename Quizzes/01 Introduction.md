# Quiz 01: Introduction

**1. What is a plan‐driven software development process?**

A plan-driven software development process is a process which makes use of large amount of planning and rigid processes to complete a software project. The planning referenced here contains comprehensive instructions, policy, and procedures for all aspects of the development cycle. Plan-driven development is centered around the major milestones of a project and the important features that they contain, favoring them over smaller milestones with less major features. While plan-driven development paradigms are vulnerable to rapid changes in requirements, they are effective in reducing risk through the development of comprehensive life-cycle plans, policies and architectures.

**2. Describe two of the six Best Practices in the Rational Unified Process.**

Two of the best practices of the Rational Unified Process are:

Develop Software Iteratively: this practice relates to the order in which software is built and how the different sub components of a system are prioritized in the development process. In this practice the items with the highest risk are developed first. User feedback is incorporated into each build cycle to ensure that the development process is kept up to date on user involvement and any potential requirements changes.

Model Software Visually: this practice deals with utilizing the Unified Modeling Language to plan out software systems in a visual and easy-to-understand manner. This assists in the viewing and analysis of software relationships and in the design of software interfaces. Modeling provides a high level overview of how the components of a system will interact and reveals each one's specific tasks and objectives.

**3. According to the RUP reading assignment for this week, what does the RUP process use to replace large volumes of documents?**

The Rational Unified Process (RUP) makes use of models instead of large amounts of documents to represent the software being developed. These models are typically created in UML and facilitate flexibility in changes to the software's lifecycle and requirements, as well as incorporating user use and feedback.

**4. Summarize Boehm's view on Agile Methods from this week's reading.   Is he a supporter, a detractor, or somewhere in the middle?  How and where does he suggest Agile Methods should be used?**

I believe that Boehm is somewhere in the middle regarding his stance on Agile Methods. This is evident on the first page of the article by his statement *"I believe that both agile and plan-driven approaches have a responsible center and overinterpreting radical fringes. Although each approach has a home ground of project characteristics within which it performs very well, and much better than the other, outside each approach’s home ground, a combined approach is feasible and preferable."*.

This quote shows that Boehm believes that each type of methodology has its own advantages, disadvantages and ideal use cases, and that it is up to an individual project's development planners to choose which method works best for them. Boehm in particular believes that Agile Methods work best when customers are willing and able to dedicate significant amounts of effort to working with the development team. He states that agile approaches "are most applicable to turbulent, high-change environments" wherein user requirements can frequently change in major ways.

**6. Are agile methods the best method for all projects? Identify a situation where a Plan Driven approach may be a better approach.**

I don't believe that Agile Methods are a one-size-fits-all comprehensive approach for software development. An example of a situation in which a Plan Driven approach may be better is in this week's homework on Driverless Cars. Because safety is a very major concern in that software system, it may be better to implement a Plan Driven approach as the critical nature of the project warrants the increased attention to detail and precision. This extra planning may be superfluous in a different project such as a website. In this automobile example, the extra investment into lifecycle architecture and planning provided by a Plan Driven approach pays dividends as the risk and impact of critical failure is significantly higher.
