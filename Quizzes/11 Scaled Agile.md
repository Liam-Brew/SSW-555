**5. Describe Scrum of Scrums.  What problem does it attempt to solve?  How is it different from SAFe?**

Scrum of Scrums is a project planning approach that seeks to nest individual scrum teams into a hierarchy. This consists of parent scrum teams managing other teams, with an overseeing scrum team in turn managing these teams. A single team is at the top and manages the whole operation. Scrum of Scrums attempts to scale Scrum to larger products that may not be conductive to a single Scrum team on its own. Scrum of Scrums is different from SAFe in that it does not allow for prolonged planning sessions due to it's greater adherence to Agile practices. SAFe on the other hand provides a more dedicated planning approach to the upper levels of management such as the portfolio and program level while still maintaining Agile's flexibility at the lower project level.
