# Quiz 10: Crystal

**1. Match the concept with the definition according to this week's reading assignment:**

Methodology: set of practices or tools

Techniques: skills needed by the team

Policies: rules followed by the organization

**2. Describe two of the techniques of Crystal Clear.**

One technique is Blitz Planning. Similar to XP's Planning Poker, Blitz Planning is used to create the initial project plan by examining the dependencies between tasks of variable complexity and implementation time. Blitz Planning includes all of a project's stakeholders and serves to help guide development in a direction that will satisfy user needs and features.

Another technique is methodology shaping. This is used to help define a process through the use of workshops to familiarize the team with a task in order to elicit an optimal solution. Additionally, interviews may be held to collect information regarding the team that can aid in organizational and planning purposes.

**3. Describe Crystal's Role Modeling sessions.  What's the goal?**

The goal of Role Modeling sessions is for the development team to become more acquainted with a user's point of view and role in the specific scenario that underlies every story. To accomplish this, user stories are written on a small card and for each card the development team discusses the background scenario which necessitated such a story. This discussion can include the situation itself, the steps the user takes in it, the objective of the user and the features involved in facilitating it.

**4. Compare and contrast XP's Planning Poker and Crystal's Blitz Planning.**

In Planning Poker, user stories are assessed individually independent of any potential dependencies on other stories. Planning Poker is done for a consistent-time sprint wherein the time the team has to work on the stories is known and will not change. Meanwhile, Blitz Planning focuses on specific tasks in a way that is considerate with potential dependencies on other tasks. Blitz assumes that the development time-cycle will not remain constant, and therefore allows flexibility in assigning and distributing resources to tasks. Overall though, both methods are used to create the initial plan of a project's development.

**5. Describe a project that requires Crystal Orange.   Why is Crystal Clear not sufficient?**

Crystal Orange is more applicable than Crystal Clear for certain applications that are medium-sized and are of moderate complexity and importance. Crystal Orange is better suited for these scenarios as it accounts for larger teams, higher risks and more thorough planning. Crystal Clear's limit of 6 developers and low risk is likely insufficient for applications of this size and scope. An example ofÂ  a project that requires Crystal Orange would be a money sending app along the lines of Venmo or Cash App. This application would need to support a large amount of users and ensure the protection of confidential data, which would be damaging both to users and the company itself if it was compromised. Crystal Clear's small team size and allocated resources would be insufficient at handling this.
