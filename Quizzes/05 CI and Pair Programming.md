# Quiz 05: CI and Pair Programming

**1. What is pair pressure? Why does it help?**

Pair pressure is the social pressure that is associated with working with another member of a team in Pair Programming. Due to this pressure, the team members are more motivated to produce high quality and efficient work for a myriad of reasons (to satisfy their partner, to look good, and to get a successful peer review). Additionally, due to the presence of two people, there is less motivation for a developer to get lazy (such as not following guidelines or abiding by standard protocol). Developers will seek to be better and produce more efficient work to maximize the productivity of their time together.

**2. Explain two advantages of Continuous Integration over Deferred Integration.**

Two advantages of Continuous Integration over Deferred Integration are:

1. In Continuous Integration, code is integrated as it is developed. This means that it is easier to locate errors as the code base to search for them in is much smaller than what you would find in Deferred Integration, who's code base would be the entire culmination of a development cycle.
2. Continuous Integration automatically tests and integrates the code. This means that less developer time must be spent on integration, allowing quicker development and a more efficient SDLC experience.

**3. Compare and contrast deferred integration and continuous integration.**

Deferred integration is when integration occurs once all of the code for a specific development time cycle has been completed. This can be difficult to work with, as errors are more easily hidden within the larger code base and revisions can be more time consuming and expensive. On the other hand, continuous integration focuses on integrating code as it is completed during the development process. This has the advantage of being a rolling integration, which means that code wont pile up at the end. This means that bug hunting and error fixing is more efficient and the team can spend more time on development. Also, continuous integration is automated, which saves even more time.

**4. Describe two of the myths of pair programming and explain why each is not true.**

One myth of pair programming is that one person does all/most of the work while the other one steals their productivity and accomplishments. This leads to the false belief that pair programming only benefits those who don't work and punishes those who do. This is not true because there are several other aspects that go into evaluating a person's effectiveness. Some examples of these are individual work assignments, work on specific issues/tickets/user stories, and peer review.

Another myth of pair programming is that it only works with a specific group of people. In actuality, pair programming actually benefits from having many groups of people with many different experiences. This larger pool of experience allows the project to have more resources that it can draw from, and not only helps the technical aspects of the project but also the learning and professional development of the team members.

**5. Williams and Upchurch report which of the following benefits for pair-programming for Computer Science students:**

- Students complete assignments more quickly with higher quality
- Students are happier and less frustrated
- Students are able to help each other to understand the concepts
