# Quiz 03: Scrum

**1. What is the purpose of a Burn-Down Chart?**

The Burn-Down Chart serves to visualize the team's progress on the development of a project. It is a line graph that plots the remaining work and stories over time. This gives an idea of how quickly a project is progressing: the steeper the slope, the more project is being made. Data from the team's completed work record may be extrapolated to calculate an estimated completion track for the remainder. This allows the team to see where they stand in regards to where they theoretically should be.

**2. Define the role of the Scrum Master.**

The purpose of the Scrum Master is to facilitate the communication of the team. The Scrum Master serves as a point of contact for the team for foreign entities to interact with. This prevents developers from having to spend time communicating with outsiders, making the development process more efficient. In addition to managing external communication, the Scrum Master also coordinates internal communications by collaborating with the different members of the team, thereby making sure that everyone is on the same page and everyone is aware of each other's status, issues and mistakes. With this being said, it is not the Scrum Master's responsibility to directly manage each developer by assigning them tasks and ensuring that they successfully complete said tasks, as the Scrum team is responsible for organizing itself.

**3. Describe the role of the Development Team using a Scrum process.**

The purpose of the Development Team is to create, test and support the technical work being done. They are normally small groups containing both general developers as well as specialists and are capable of operating independently. The Development Team is able to organize itself and decide on its own work break down structure in terms of assignments, responsibilities and processes.

**4. Describe who attends and what happens at the Sprint Planning meeting.**

The Sprint Planning meeting is attended by the Product Owner, Scrum Master and entire Dev Team. This meeting preempts the start of a sprint's development work and features the assignment of the sprint's work breakdown structure in terms of who will be completing what features. During this time the team will discuss the state of the project and what deliverables are desired for the next sprint. The team is able to collaborate on the workload, assigning tasks to those who are best able to complete them and hosting a feedback/discussion session before settling on a plan.

**5. Compare and contrast the Product, Release and Sprint backlog.**

The Product backlog represents the required features of a product determined by stakeholders. The development team themselves can add features, with this being useful as the Product backlog must contain the underlying technology responsible for facilitating the project's operation. The Product backlog is a collection of several releases.

The Release backlog is a collection of several sprints and features that will comprise the next product release. The Product Owner defines and has authority over the Release backlog.

The Sprint backlog represents the most immediate list of features that will be implemented in the next sprint.
