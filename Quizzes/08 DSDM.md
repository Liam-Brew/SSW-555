# Quiz 08: DSDM

**1. Why would RAD not work on a project with a traditional customer-supplier relationship?**

Because RAD is very much dependent on a lot of communication, it would not work in a traditional customer-supplier relationship. This is because customers and users play an active role throughout the different phases of the RAD process beyond the initial set-up period shared with a traditional customer-supplier relationship. The need for this extra amount of communication can therefore not be filled in a more traditional environment.

**2. Describe two of the principles of DSDM that are consistent with the Agile Manifesto.**

One principle of DSDM is the importance of rapid delivery. This is similar to Agile's continuous delivery model in which constant incremental progress gains on a project are made. The objective for both DSDM and Agile here is that customer interaction is increased with the developer team, with both entities being able to share feedback and inform each other of any changes or issues more frequently as new milestones and progress is being delivered.

Another principle of DSDM that overlaps with Agile is the importance of amount of user interaction between the stakeholder and development team. This helps the customer have a better understanding of how their project is progressing and makes them more aware of any changes or issues. Additionally, this helps the development team better gauge the customer's response and feedback to progress and ensure that they are doing this correctly.Â This therefore leads to a stronger project.

**3. What is produced by the Feasibility Study of DSDM?**

The Feasibility Study of DSDM produces the Feasibility report. This report provides an analysis to determine how feasible the solution to a project is and what the expected costs and difficulties will be. To create this report, the project's requirements are examined as well as business strategy and analysis. In addition to this, the Feasibility Study also produces a risk log that provides a general overview of the risks associated with completing the project as well as a preliminary project schedule and budget.

**4. According to Clifton, under what circumstances is DSDM most likely to succeed?  What are the criteria?**

Clifton states that in order for DSDM to succeed, the following must be true:

1. Management must be fully committed to the idea and process of using DSDM
2. The team needs to be able to physically meet together easily and ensure proper communication takes place at all times
3. The team needs to be able to communicate and work together well with very little issues that my inhibit contact and team work

**5. Describe the MoSCoW rules for requirements. How are they used in DSDM?**

The MoSCoW rules for requirements dictate the hierarchy of importance for each group of requirements. These are must have, should have, could have, and want to have requirements. Must have requirements are critical to the system's success, with the importance decreasing down the list to want-to-have ones, which are considered added bonuses. DSDM uses MoSCoW requirements to organize the implementation of requirements according to their ordered priority. According to DSDM/MoSCoW best practices, for each iteration of work the team should dedicate 60% of their efforts to the must-have requirements while dividing the remaining 40% among should-haves, could-haves and want-to-haves according to their priority.
