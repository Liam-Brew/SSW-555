# Lecture 00: Software Project Challenges

Most software project failures consist of

- poor planning
- inadequate requirements understanding
- inadequate attention to quality
- failure to respond to problems until its too late

Challenges

- feasability and profitability -> should the project be done?
- requirements -> what needs to be done?
- planning and controlling -> who does what and when?
- implementation -> creating software
- delivery and maintenance -> delivery to users, responding to needed changes
- support -> environment and tools needed for prohect
- teamwork -> making sure everyone is on the same page

Agile is the ability to respond to change.

## Feasability and profitability

What is the market?

- who will pay for and use the system?
- how much will they pay?
- how will the market change?

How expensive will the project me?

- effort
- calendar time
- available resources
- purchased or leased resources

What are the risks?

## Requirements

Which features should be produced?
What are the non-functional requirements?

- reliability
- security
- maintainability
- efficiency
- usability
- price
- time to market

## Planning and Controlling

Long term planning

- release schedule
- lifetime of product

Project planning

- who does what
- relationship and communication with stakeholders
- scheduling of tasks

Project management

- reviewing and tracking progress
- deciding when something is "done"
- taking corrective action

Project communication

- what information is shared across project
- how information is shared across project
- how decisions are made and communicated

## Implementation

High level design and architecture

- creation
- communication to project staff
- maintenance

Low level design (similar to high level design)
Programming

- creation methods (ex: pairs, coding standards)
- review
- maintenance

Verification and validation

- types of reviews and tests
- who does what?

## Delivery and Maintenance

How often are releases delivered and installed?
Who does what?
How are issues detected, recorded, reported and tracked?
How are change requests managed?

## Support

Software development methods

- training
- mentors and guides

Tools

- version control and configuration management
- editors and programming environments
- compilers and code generators
- static analysis tools
- testing tools
- bug tracking tools

Physical space

- project workspace
- individual workspace

## Teamwork

Software development is not a solitary activity
Communication between team members is essential

- some knowledge needs to be shared immediately
- no one knows everything

Collaboration among team members is essential

- group activities
- dependencies between activities and components

Project success depends on the success of the entire team
